        <p>Have you ever wondered when you want to die? How long you want live your life?</p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Death is the thing people do not want to talk about even it is something we can not pracetice.
          When you compare your present age with the age at which you expect to die, how much of your life do you find youâ€™ve already lived? A third, a half, two thirds, or more?
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Having a good death depends on HOW do you live your life. Life is all about "Living" not just "Staying alive".</p>
